The description.

This program is a simple tool for printing text files to a console. It is similar to the Unix "cat" utility.
Txt view breaks up a large text file into a few pages while it prints to the console.
Each page is 25 lines. Use the Enter key to go to the next page.

This program takes a target file name as the command-line argument.

The source code.

The code was compiled under Open Watcom.
You can compile it with any modern C compiler.
The source code can compile for a wide range of operating systems, but you need to create a makefile or a build script by yourself.
I provide the binary file for Windows and the makefile for Linux.

Install and uninstall under Linux.

Follow these steps:

1. Extract the content of the source code archive.
2. Open a terminal and go to the source code directory.
3.
Run as root to install: make install
Run as root to uninstall: make uninstall
